Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Cat vs Dog Classification - README
This README provides an overview of the code you've provided for building, training, and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying cat and dog images. The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images and then tested on individual images.

Introduction
This code demonstrates the process of building and training a CNN model for binary classification of cat and dog images. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, and the model is trained using the training set. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set. Additionally, the trained model is used to make predictions on individual cat or dog images.

Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

TensorFlow (2.x)
Keras
NumPy

You can install these requirements using the following command:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy

Usage
Data Preprocessing: The training and test images are preprocessed using the  class from Keras. The images are rescaled, sheared, zoomed, and flipped for data augmentation.ImageDataGenerator

Building the CNN Model: The CNN model is built using the Sequential API from Keras. It consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a flattening layer, fully connected layers, and an output layer.

Training the CNN Model: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. It's then trained using the  method on the training set and validated on the test set.fit

Making a Single Prediction: The trained model is loaded, and a single test image is loaded and preprocessed. The model predicts whether the image contains a cat or a dog, and the result is displayed.

Results
The training process involves 25 epochs, and the model's accuracy and loss are recorded for each epoch. After training, the model's performance on the test set is also displayed. The training and validation accuracy generally improve over the epochs, indicating that the model is learning the features of the images.

Making a Single Prediction
To make a single prediction using the trained model:

Load a test image using  from .load_imgtensorflow.keras.utils
Preprocess the image using  and .np.arraynp.expand_dims
Use the trained model to predict whether the image contains a cat or a dog.
Display the prediction result.
